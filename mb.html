    <p class="five">A computer is a machine that can store and process information. Most computers rely on a binary system, which uses two variables, 0 and 1, to complete tasks such as storing data, calculating algorithms, and displaying information.This article is about the branch of computer science and mathematics. For the journal, see Theoretical Computer Science (journal).
        Theoretical computer science is a subfield of computer science and mathematics that focuses on the abstract and mathematical foundations of computation.
        
        It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The ACM's Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) provides the following description:[1]
        
        TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, algorithmic game theory, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra. Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.

          <p class="seven">While logical inference and mathematical proof had existed previously, in 1931 Kurt GÃ¶del proved with his incompleteness theorem that there are fundamental limitations on what statements could be proved or disproved.

            Information theory was added to the field with a 1948 mathematical theory of communication by Claude Shannon. In the same decade, Donald Hebb introduced a mathematical model of learning in the brain. With mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the fields of neural networks and parallel distributed processing were established. </p>

      <p class="two">Computing technology is an emerging field of engineering that helps in the activity of designing, constructing, and programming computers. It is the combination of both hardware and software that makes it easier for the user to solve complex and dynamic problems efficiently.</p>
